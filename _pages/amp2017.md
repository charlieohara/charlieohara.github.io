This site contains all the supplementary materials for my poster "Soft typology arises from learning bias even with markedness hierarchies" presented at AMP 2017, NYU, 9/15/17.

The poster itself is available as a pdf at the title above.

 

Below are several animation files to illustrate the results of learning different languages with different constraint sets.

In actual typology, languages that allow just [k p] and [t] word initially (in terms of voiceless stops), but none word-finally are quite common, and languages that allow only [p t] word initially and word finally (i.e. No-K) are not observed. In the simulation below, the y-axis represents the harmonic difference (difference of harmony scores) between the faithful and deletion candidate (i.e. H(/Vt/竊端V])-H(/Vt/竊端Vt])) on an average simulation of learning. When a form reaches the blue line, it is surfaces faithfully 50% of the time, and once it reaches the red line it surfaces 90% of the time. Red forms are not given in the training data. As we can see, with both Onset and NoCoda, even without /kV/竊端kV] in the training data, it is learned before /Vp/竊端Vp].
