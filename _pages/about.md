I recieved my PhD in Linguistics from the University of Southern California in 2021. My dissertation is entitled "Soft Biases in Phonology: Learnability meets grammar". My work focuses on using computational and mathematical methods to understand how the process of learning phonological structure influences the likelihood of certain structures appearing in the languages of the world. Particularly, my work is on the ways learning can gradiently affect typology, and on the development of algorithms to learn underlying representations. Currently, I am a Lecturer in the department of Linguistics at the University of Michigan. 

My Research Interests
======
 * Phonology
    * Phonological learning
    * Learning's effect on soft typology.  <details> <summary> Expand</summary>
  I use simulations to identify which grammars in a typology would be most consistently learned accurately across generations, and to understand the subtle interactions of learning and grammar. (This is the topic of my dissertation; See my poster at AMP 2017, and my LSA 2018 talk on this. Other chapters of my dissertation explore how lexical frequency of different forms affect learnability (Workshop on Analyzing Typological Structure, AMP 2018), as well as whether substantive biases can be restricted to the channel (Workshop on the Emergence of Universals).</details
